* Torpedo hitting a star (range of effect is no star damage, to star explosion of 5000 to 20,000)

* Enterprise full has 10000 units of energy (max 2000 in shields) and 20 torpedoes
* (Guidance) Enterprise should have roughly 10x the firepower of individual Klingons
* 10 units of energy per sector on navigation
* 100 units of energy per quadrant on warp (300 units per quadrant with shields up)
* phasers can be fired up/down/right/left each of which cut the dissipation by 4





* phaser energy dissipates Pdest = PInitial / 2Pi*r (r in sectors). If the captain elects to send phasor in just one "quadrant", the it is Pdest = 2 * Pinit / Pi*r
